# Uber Realms #

Uber Realms is a private [Realm of the Mad God](http://uber-realms.com/download.html) (RotMG) server. In recent years, development and updates for RotMG have rapidly decreased. The global user base is still over 100,000 active weekly players, but there is a strong desire for new content and improved game play. The goal of this project is to:

- Make it easier for others to host private RotMG Servers (hosted and local)
- Clean up the existing code to make it less error prone and more efficient
- To provide a fun, more frequently updated, version of the RotMG Official Servers
