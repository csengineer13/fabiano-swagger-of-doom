# Uber Realms #

Uber Realms is a private [Realm of the Mad God](http://uber-realms.com/download.html) (RotMG) server. In recent years, development and updates for RotMG have rapidly decreased. The global user base is still over 100,000 active weekly players, but there is a strong desire for new content and improved game play. The goal of this project is to:

- Make it easier for others to host private RotMG Servers (hosted and local)
- Clean up the existing code to make it less error prone and more efficient
- To provide a fun, more frequently updated, version of the RotMG Official Servers

## How Do I Host A Private Server? ##

Note, there are many different ways to "host" a server for yourself and your friends to play on. The easiest option is to "host" locally. The harder option, the one that will take money, time, and familiarity with servers, is to host using a "virtual private server". However, you will notice less lag, and be able to support more active/online users.
